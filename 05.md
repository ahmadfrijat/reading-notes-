# Node.js :

 * Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
 * A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
