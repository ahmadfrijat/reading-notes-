# Trees : 

  * tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

## Traversals : 

  * An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

     1. Depth First
     2. Breadth First

## Depth First : 

  * Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

## Breadth First : 

  * Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time
