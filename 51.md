# Stacks and Queues 

## What is a Stack :

  * A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## FILO : First In Last Out 

  * This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

## LIFO : Last In First Out

  * This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Stack Visualization :

 * the topmost item is denoted as the top. When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new top. When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next

## What is a Queue :

  * A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.”

## FIFO : First In First Out

  * This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

## LILO : Last In Last Out

  * This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
