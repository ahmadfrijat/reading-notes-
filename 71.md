# Redux - Asynchronous Actions : 

## How granular should your reducers be?

 * There should be a separate reducer function for each slice of data. They are combined before being put into the store.

## Pro or Con - multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched 

 * When your reducer has finished and returned the new application state, asyncDispatch will trigger store. dispatch with whatever action you give to it. You might try using a library like redux-saga.

## Name a strategy for preventing the above

 * Using Redux middleware thunk, allows for evaluating the actions.

## Vocabulary Terms :

 1. Store : Holds the whole state tree of the application, only way to change the state inside is to dispatch an action on it.
 2. Combined Reducers : It turns out that Redux lets us combine multiple reducers into one that can be passed into createStore by using a helper function named combineReducers . The way we combine reducers is simple, we create one file per reducer in the reducers directory. We also create a file called index. js inside the reducers directory.

## Preview : 

 * async action : Writing an Async Function Middleware# Both of the middleware in that last section were very specific and only do one thing. It would be nice if we had a way to write any async logic ahead of time, separate from the middleware itself, and still have access to dispatch and getState so that we can interact with the store.
 * What if we wrote a middleware that let us pass a function to dispatch, instead of an action object? We could have our middleware check to see if the "action" is actually a function instead, and if it's a function, call the function right away. That would let us write async logic in separate functions, outside of the middleware definition.

 * thunk middleware : Allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action , and Can be used to delay dispatch or conditionally dispatch 
 * “The term originated as a humorous past-tense version of ‘think’.”
