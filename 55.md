## What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

  * FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received? 

 * A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a tag attached to a message to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the message. It is derived by applying a MAC algorithm to a message in combination with a secret key.

## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

 * It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events".

## How do you test an event driven system? 

  * There are multiple levels of tests you will typically write for your system. In the most canonical case

## Vocabulary Terms :

  3. WRRC : The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.

## Preview :

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
