# Socket.io

## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets? 

  * Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. If a packet is not received or is "dropped," only the dropped packet needs to be resent

## UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this? 

  * UDP is a connectionless protocol. No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself.

## Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections? 

  * A server socket listens on a single port 

## Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers? 

  * Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs

## Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection? 

  * yes


## Vocabulary Terms : 

  1. Observer Pattern : is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
  2. Listener : An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.
  3. Event Handler : scripts that are automatically executed when an event occurs. Event handlers are embedded in documents as attributes of HTML tags to which you assign JavaScript code to execute.
  4. Event Driven Programming : is when a program is designed to respond to user engagement in various forms. It is known as a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by “events.” Events are any user interaction, such as a click or key press, in response to prompt from the system.
  5. Event Loop : The event loop is also sometimes referred to as the message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop. The event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file interface, which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling).
  6. Event Queue : A JavaScript runtime uses a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed. Each message has an associated function which gets called in order to handle the message. At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one.
  7. Call Stack : A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function,
  8. Emit/Raise/Trigger : in event-driven programming, emit sends a message to trigger a response and raise an event
  9. Subscribe : The subscriber function defines how to obtain or generate values or messages to be published. To execute the observable you have created and begin receiving notifications, you call its subscribe() method, passing an observer. This is a JavaScript object that defines the handlers for the notifications you receive.
  10. database : A database is a data structure that stores organized information. Most databases contain multiple tables, which may each include several different fields. For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees, and financial records


## Preview 

* WebSocket :  is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
* Socket.IO : is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.

## Difference Between WebSocket and Socket.io 

 * WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.
 * Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. Generally, it is divided into two parts; both WebSocket vs Socket.io are event-driven libraries.
