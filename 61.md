# Component Composition :

## Can a parent component access the state of a child component? 

  * In React we can access the child's state using Refs. we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child's state. Creating Refs Refs are created using React.

## What can be passed along in a prop variable?

  * render prop is “a simple technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.” Instead of passing a string or object, you pass a function as a prop. renderProp={() => "Passing a function as a prop!"}

## How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

  * To obtain the state of another component, you can pass a component's state to its child components as props. Also, you can have components share a common ancestor, and have them access the same state in a similar manner.

## Vocabulary Terms : 

 1. component props : Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
 2. component state : The heart of every React component is its “state”, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.
 3. application state : Application state is a global storage mechanism that used to stored data on the server and shared for all users, means data stored in Application state is common for all user. Data from Application state can be accessible anywhere in the application. Application state is based on the System. Web.

## Preview : 

* The React docs say that you can use props. children on components that represent 'generic boxes' and that 'don't know their children ahead of time'. ... children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component
* React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components
* React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components.
