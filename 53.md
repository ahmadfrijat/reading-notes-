# Message Queues 

## What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful? 

  * Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange, WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time.

## Does socket.io use HTTP? Why? 

  * socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code .

## What happens when a client emits an event? 

  * The event will be sent to the server, which will be listening for the event if already connected

## What happens when a server emits an event?

  * An event emitter is a pattern that listens to a named event, fires a callback, then emits that event with a value. Sometimes this is referred to as a “pub/sub” model, or listener. It's referring to the same thing

## What happens if a client “misses” an event?

  * Unhandled messages are ignored, behaves as if there is no event listener for the event

## How can we mitigate this? 

  * you can avoid missing events by having a handler for each event that take an action.

## Vocabulary Terms 

  1. Socket : A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
  2. Web Socket : s a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.
  3. Socket.IO :  enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.
  4. Client : The Client ID (cid) is a unique identifier for a browser–device pair that helps Google Analytics link user actions on a site. By default, Google Analytics determines unique users using this parameter.
  5. Server : A server is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients, can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet. 
  6. OSI Model : The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.
  7. TCP Model : The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model. The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer
  8. TCP : TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
  9. UDP : UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
  10. Packets : A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data) being transferred


## Chat example using socket 

  * Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.
  * This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

## Rooms and Namespaces
  * A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.
