# EJS:


 - ### Use EJS to Template Your Node Application:
 
  - EJS Partials footer.ejs, head.ejs, header.ejs:
   -  call those partials and define three files we'll use across all of our site: head.ejs, header.ejs, and footer.ejs
   
- Using EJS Partials :
  -  The syntax to use an EJS partial is: <% include FILENAME %>
- Single Variable:
  - To echo a single variable, we just use <%= tagline %>.
  
- Looping Over Data
  - To loop over our data, we will use .forEach

- Conclusion
  - EJS let's us spin up quick applications when we don't need anything too complex.
  - By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.
