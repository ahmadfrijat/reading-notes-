# Routing :

 ## Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
 
  *  we can see there is no way to pass props from a child component to a parent component. However, we can always pass around functions from the parent to child component. The child component can then make use of these functions. The function can then update the state in a parent component, as we saw above.

 ## When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
 
  * By add the component as a children props

 ## Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
 
  * Yes , we can.

 ## What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
 
  * you could pass them all by just listing them out individually as the new props for the child component.

 ## Vocabulary Terms : 
 
  1. props.children : used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
  2. composition : is a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop.

 ## Preview : 
 
 ### The Router :
 * React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
 
 * When starting a new project, you need to determine which type of router to use. For browser based projects, there are <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter> components. The <BrowserRouter> should be used when you have a server that will handle dynamic requests (knows how to respond to any possible URI), while the <HashRouter> should be used for static websites (where the server can only respond to requests for files that it knows about).

 * Usually it is preferable to use a <BrowserRouter>, but if your website will be hosted on a server that only serves static files, then the <HashRouter> is a good solution.
