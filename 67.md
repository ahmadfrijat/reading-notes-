## Why is the Context API useful? 

 * The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

## Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

 * The most common way to access Context from a class component is via the static contextType 

## What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

 * Themes. The ability to set the theme is one of the best UX. ...
 * Multilingual application. To implement multiple languages in app we have to change the text in every component and replace with the translated text. ...
 * Authorisation: setting the user role and info.

## Describe “Context Hell”

 * When using the context API, splitting global state properties so as not to share a “god object” creates “Context hell,” a layer of countless contexts wrapping your React application.

## Vocabulary Terms 

 1. global state : Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, managing state in multiple components that are not directly connected.
 2. global context : Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components
 3. provider : The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected to the store, most applications will render a <Provider> at the top level, with the entire app's component tree inside of it.
 4. consumer : A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

 * Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
 * Role-based access control (RBAC) refers to the idea of assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization. It offers a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less prone to error than assigning permissions to users individually.
