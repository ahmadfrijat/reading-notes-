# Authentication : 

## Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms) : 

    *  the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes :

    * To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and static factory method.
      1. Static member: It gets memory only once because of static, itcontains the instance of the Singleton class.
      2. Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.

## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it? 


```
class PrivateSingleton {
    constructor() {
        this.message = 'I am an instance';
    }
}
class Singleton {
    constructor() {
        throw new Error('Use Singleton.getInstance()');
    }
    static getInstance() {
        if (!Singleton.instance) {
            Singleton.instance = new PrivateSingleton();
        }
        return Singleton.instance;
    }
}
module.exports = Singleton;
```

* create a simpletest.jsfile:

```
const Singleton = require('./Singleton');
const object = Singleton.getInstance(); 
console.log(object.message);   // Prints out: 'I am an instance'
object.message = 'Foo Bar';    // Overwrite message property
const instance = Singleton.getInstance();
console.log(instance.message); // Prints out: 'Foo Bar'
```


## Vocabulary Terms : 

* Router Middleware : The term is composed of 2 words router and middleware. Middleware. It is a piece of code that comes in the middle of request and response . It kind of hijacks your request so that you can do anything that you want with your request or response eg: Modify the data or call the next middleware
* Dynamic Module Loading : Export and import statements that we covered in previous chapters are called “static”. The syntax is very simple and strict.
* Singleton Pattern : is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
* CRUD -> REST Method Matches : It is an acronym for C - create, R - read/retrieve, U -update, D - delete- the four basic functions that are implemented in any relational DB applications. Each of it can map to a standard SQL statement, HTTP protocol method or Data Distribution Service (DDS).
* Mock Testing : Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones
