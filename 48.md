## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

   1. Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories. Avoid git add * commands on git. Add sensitive files in .gitignore. Don't rely on code reviews to discover secrets.
   2. Don't share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack.
   3. Store secrets safely.
   4. Restrict API access and permissions.


## Vocabulary Terms : 

   1. encryption : A mathematical procedure for performing encryption on data. Through the use of an algorithm, information is made into meaningless cipher text and requires the use of a key to transform the data back into its original form
   2. token : is a protocol which allows users to verify their identity, and in return receive a unique access token
   3. bearer :  is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
   4. secret : secret string stored on the server used to sign and encode the token . 
   5. JSON Web Token : is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

  ## Role Based Access Control RBAC :
  
     *  is a security paradigm whereby users are granted access to resources based on their role in the company. 

  ## 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC) : 
  
     1. Inventory your systems
     2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
     3. Assign people to roles
     4. Never make one-off changes
     5. Audit
