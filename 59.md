# What’s the difference between a framework and a library ?

  * The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

# Vocabulary Terms :

  1. Rendering :  takes HTML code and interprets it into what you see visually. For instance, a tag would be interpreted by the rendering engine as a set of instructions to make the text inside of the element bold.
  2. Templates : are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of any particular type. A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function.
  3. State : is information your program manipulates to accomplish some task. It is data or information that gets changed or manipulated throughout the runtime of a program.

# Preview : 

 * The smallest React example looks like this:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

 * Introducing JSX : it is a syntax extension to JavaScript , it used with React to describe what the UI should look like , it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
 * JSX produces React “elements”
 * Rendering Elements : is the only required method in a class component, and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered to the browser window.
