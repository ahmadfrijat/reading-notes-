# Bearer Authorization :

## Write the following steps in the correct order: 

 1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
 2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
 3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
 4. Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
 5. Receive authorization code
 6. Make a request to the access token endpoint
 7. Receive access token

## What can you do with an authorization code?

 * The only thing you can do with the authorization code is to make a request to get an access token.

## What can you do with an access token? 

 * The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.

## What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

 * Better security, token management provides you with a means of tracking each connected device that uses your API.

## Vocabulary Terms 

1. Client ID: The Client ID (cid) is a unique identifier for a browser–device pair that helps Google Analytics link user actions on a site. By default, Google Analytics determines unique users using this parameter.
2. Client Secret: secret known only to the application and the authorization server
3. Authentication Endpoint: The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out, access APIs, and more.
4. An API endpoint:is a point at which an application program interface (API) – the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other – connects with the software program.
5. authorization code: is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request.
6. Access Token: An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity.


## JSON Web Tokens : 

 * is an Internet proposed standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. 
 * The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client.
 * When to use JSON web token : 
      1. authorization
      2. information exchange
