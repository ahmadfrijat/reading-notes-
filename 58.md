# AWS: Events :

## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

  * FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received? 

  * By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.

## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

  * The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## Vocabulary Terms :

  1. Serverless API : Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. 
  2. Triggers : are anything that might cause a person to recall a traumatic experience they've had. 
  3. Dynamo vs Mongo : DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.
  4. Dynamoose vs Mongoose : Dynamoose is a DynamoDB API structured like Mongoose, lets us provide a schema and perform CRUD operations against a DynamoDB table, installed via node and configured based on role


## Preview 

* AWS SNS is a publisher subscriber network, where subscribers can subscribe to topics and will receive messages whenever a publisher publishes to that topic. AWS SQS is a queue service, which stores messages in a queue.
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS lets you decouple the components of a cloud application. Amazon SQS includes standard queues with high throughput and at-least-once processing, and FIFO queues that provide FIFO (first-in, first-out) delivery and exactly-once processing.
