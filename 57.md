# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda 

## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

  * FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

  * By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.

## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? 

  * The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## How do you test an event driven system?

  
## Vocabulary Terms :

  1. Serverless Functions : A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier
  2. Cloud Storage : is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company.
  3. CDN : content delivery network  is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. 

## Preview :

* Amazon API Gateway : is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.
  
* DynamoDB : is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

    1. reliable performance even as it scales;
    2. a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
    3. a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

* Dynamoose : is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
