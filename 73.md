## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” 

 * Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. (source: Medium (Links to an external site.)) Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
  
 * Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

## Vocabulary Terms : 

 1. redux toolkit slices : A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.
 2. namespace : A namespace component is another feature request that is available in React JSX. By using the standard JavaScript syntax approach, which is object property access, this feature is useful for assigning components directly as <Namespace

## Preview 

 * React Native brings React’s declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform . also means a great, collaborative community of developers from all around the world. We scanned through the blogging platforms and social media sites and created a list of the best React Native experts & blogs.
 * React has proved tremendously successful, both on my own projects, and with many others around the web, including large companies like Netflix. And now with React Native, the framework has been brought to mobile. React Native is a great option for creating performant iOS and Android apps that feel at home on their respective platforms, all while building on any previous web development experience.
