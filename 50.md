# Event Driven Application :

## Why is access control important? 

  * Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. 

## Describe an application that would need access control. 

  * Access cards for access sensitive areas. Biometric to access the data centres and computer rooms. User name and password and PIN numbers is another example of access control.

## What is a role used for? 

  * A user role defines permissions for users to perform a group of tasks. In a default WordPress installation there are some predefined roles with a predefined set of permissions. These roles are Super Admin, Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber.

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control? 

  * For most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead. ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.

## Vocabulary Terms :

  1. Authorization : is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features
  2. Role-based access control (RBAC) : restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
  3. Capabilities : is a scheme used by some computers to control access to memory as an efficient implementation of capability-based security. 


## Preview :

   ### Node. js Events :
   
    * Events in Node. js. Every action on a computer is an event
    * Events Module. Node. js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events
    * The EventEmitter Object. You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object.
    
   ### Event-Driven Programming in Node.js:
   
    * Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision

   ### EventEmitter :
   
   * Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.
