# Props and State :


## Does a deployed React application require a server? 
  
   * You don't necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.

## Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level? 

  * You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code. ... Iteration speed vs Realistic environment: Some tools offer a very quick ... change and seeing the result, but don't model the browser behavior precisely. 

## What does npm run build do?

  * npm run build runs the script "build" and created a script which runs your application - let's say server.js.

## Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application 

  * Unlike other UI libraries and frameworks, Reactjs doesn't enforce an architecture pattern. It is just a view that caters to the user interface. Just beneath the user interface lies a tree of several React components.


## Vocabulary Terms :

 1. BDD : Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach to software development that bridges the communication gap between business and IT. BDD helps teams communicate requirements with more precision, discover defects early and produce software that remains maintainable over time.
 2. Acceptance Tests : An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.
 3. mounting : Mounting is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM). This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted.
 4. build : Building a React project on our machine requires an elaborate workflow whether it is a single page or a multipage application.

## Preview :

## Workings of `setState()`
* setState() is the only legitimate way to update state after the initial state setup. Letâ€™s say we have a search component and want to display the search term a user submits.

## Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
## Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.
