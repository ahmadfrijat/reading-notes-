# Hooks API : 

## Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

 * we can implement multiple routes in a React application. A user browsing this app feels each route is each page. So in React, multiple routes are considered as multiple pages.

## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

  * Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />

## What does props.children contain?

 * props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

## Vocabulary Terms : 

 1. Composition : React Composition is a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop.
 2. Children / Child Components : is a more specific part inside a parent component. Example would be a parent component being a PERSON. ARMS and LEGS are child components of it.
 3. Hash Routing : Hash value will be handled by react router. It is used to support legacy browsers which usually doesn't support HTML pushState API  It doesn't need any configuration in server to handle routes  This route isn't recommended by the team who created react router package.
 4. Link Routing : Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application.

### Hooks :

* What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.
* Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
* Hooks don’t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes.
* When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.
* useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.
