# Application State with Redux :

## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage” 

 * Implementing or storing your token in cookies makes the application stateful. Having HttpOnly Flag will secure the cookie from malicious JavaScript attacks (i.e. XSS-attack). XSS-attack is an attack where an entity injects a malicious script to the victims' website.

## Explain 3rd party cookies.

 * Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites he visited.

## How do pixel tags work?

 * Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.

## Vocabulary Terms 

 1. cookies : Cookies, a mechanism for persisting data locally in a browser, can be incorporated into your React project in a matter of minutes. If you have React Router 4 and React Redux installed, some extra prop management is required to get your cookie object arriving at the correct Components.
 2. Authorization : is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features
 3. Access control : is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who's allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.
 4. Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API.


## Preview :

 * React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.
 * Provider : React Redux includes a <Provider /> component, which makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app
 * Hooks :
    1. React Redux provides a pair of custom React hooks that allow your React components to interact with the Redux store.
    2. useSelector reads a value from the store state and subscribes to updates, while useDispatch returns the store's dispatch method to let you dispatch actions.
