## Javascript Templating : 
 
  * Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
  * The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
  
## Mustache :  
  
  * Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

## Flexbox :

  * The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
