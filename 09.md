# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING :

  * Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 
  
# pure functions:
  * It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
  * It does not cause any observable side effects
