## Javascript Templating:
 
* Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

## Flexbox :

* display :
  - This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
* flex-direction :
  - This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
* flex-wrap :
  - By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
