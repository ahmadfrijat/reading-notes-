# Express REST API : 

 ## Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

## True or false: The route handler is middleware? 
    * false.

## In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
    *  all middleware that is meant to handle errors will be called in order until one of them does not call the next() function call.

## At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
    * between the request and before the response is sent, or it could be listed after the route being requested, but before the callback. 

## What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
    * when sending more than one response for a one request.

    * Routing Middleware : refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing.
    * Test Driven Development : is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
    * Behavioral Testing : is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.
