# AWS: S3 and Lambda :


## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

  * FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received? 

  * A Message Authentication Code is a tag attached to a message to ensure integrity and authenticity

## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

  * The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## How do you test an event driven system? 

  * event-driven application architecture is one in which services (aka functions) within an application input data and output data via messages that are stored in a message queue. This differs from a synchronous architecture, in which data is passed straight to a service by making a direct call.


## Vocabulary Terms : 

  1. Server Instances : is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
  2. Containers : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
  3. Cloud Services : Cloud services are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.
  4. Cloud Architecture : Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems.
  5. AWS : Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. In simple words AWS allows you to do the following things- Running web and application servers in the cloud to host dynamic websites.


## Preview : 

  * Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) :  is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
  * This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.
  * AWS Lambda : is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.
  * A Content Delivery Network (CDN) :  is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
