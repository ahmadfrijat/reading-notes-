# Hashtables :

* hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

## Why do we use them?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

## What Are they

* Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
* The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
* Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. This is ideal when quick lookups are required.

## Creating a Hash

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.

* Example :

```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16.
