# Context API :

## Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer() 

 * The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value. In Computer Science, memoization is a concept used in general when we don't need to recompute the function with a given argument for the next time as it returns the cached result.
 *  useReducer hook is generally used for complex/global state management. In those cases, both the action as well as a state will be objects. In that case, it is the convention to use a "type" property in the "action" object to make changes to the state.

## Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

 * It’s a convention, and without it react wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of hooks.

## What do custom hooks usually do?

 * Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated

## Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications


## Vocabulary Terms :

 1. reducer : is a hook I use sometimes to manage the state of the application.It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application.

## Preview :

 * “useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level. Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.

### When to Use Context 

 * Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language
