1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH? 
  * The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  * [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
  * [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/)
  * [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
  * 400s: Client error codes indicating that there was a problem with the request.
  * 500s: Server error codes indicating that the request was accepted, but that an error on the server prevented the fulfillment of the request.

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST 
  * Soap Advantages
     * SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:
      1. Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)
      2. Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication) Standardized
      3. Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
      4. Built-in error handling
      5. Automation when used with certain language products

 * REST Advantages
     * REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages over SOAP:
      1. No expensive tools require to interact with the web service
      2. Smaller learning curve
      3. Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST can use smaller message formats)
      4. Fast (no extensive processing required)
      5. Closer to other web technologies in design philosophy




## Web Server : 
* is server software, or a system of one or more computers dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client HTTP requests on the public World Wide Web or also on private LANs and WANs.
## Express : 
* is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
## Routing : 
* refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
## WRRC : 
* The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers.
