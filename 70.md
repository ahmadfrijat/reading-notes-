# Redux - Combined Reducers : 

## Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state? 

 * Context API is easy to is use as it has a short learning curve. It requires less code, and because there's no need of extra libraries, bundle sizes are reduced. Redux on the other hand requires adding more libraries to the application bundle. The syntax is complex and extensive creating unnecessary work and complexity.

## What is the purpose of a reducer?

 * A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

## What does an action contain? 

 * Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store. As discussed earlier, actions are plain JavaScript object that must have a type attribute to indicate the type of action performed.

## Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

 * Then the function uses a switch statement to determine which type of action it's dealing with. If there is an unknown action, then it should return the state , so that the application doesn't lose its current state.

## Vocabulary Terms 

 1. immutable state : React state should be treated as immutable. ... This means a manual state mutation may be overridden when setState is processed. If you declare a shouldComponentUpdate method, you can't use a === equality check inside because the object reference will not change.
 2. time travel in redux : The Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time. ... This makes it possible to inspect the state and travel back in time to a previous application state without reloading the page or restarting the app.
 3. action creator : An action creator is merely a function that returns an action object. Redux includes a utility function called bindActionCreators for binding one or more action creators to the store's dispatch() function.
 4. reducer : A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. ... Redux relies heavily on reducer functions that take the previous state and an action in order to execute the next state.
 5. dispatch : dispatch is a function of the Redux store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for you.

## Preview :

* combineReducers : The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.
* The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
* The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()
