# Redux - Additional Topics

## What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

 * The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount ) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app.

## When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

 * You will still be exporting the new data to replace the state from the reducer. The action calling the reducer will be sent as a function rather than an object.


## Vocabulary Terms

 1. middleware : Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.
 2. thunk : Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. … Redux Thunk allows us to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.


## Preview : 

 * Redux Toolkit : Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic, and we strongly recommend that you use it.
 * Redux Toolkit was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux: 
             1. Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
             2. I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
             3. Redux requires too much boilerplate code

 
 * Why You Should Use Redux Toolkit :
    * Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.
