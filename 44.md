# Data Modeling:

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development 
  
  1.You spend less time in the debugger.
  2.You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.
  3.TDD creates SOLID code.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

 *  beforeEach for tests that consume a particular global state for each test.
 *  Use afterEach for reset the environment after a test has run.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
 
 * The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system, rather the understanding behind why a test 'should' return one specific value rather than any other resides only in the developer's head.


## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
 
 * ES6 Classes more simple and efficient than Constructor/Prototype Classes.

## Why REST?
 
 * The REST architecture generally consists of clients, servers, resources, and a vocabulary of HTTP operations known as request methods. In essence, clients send requests to servers and servers respond. These interactions are centered around representations of resources such as a document or URI. These representations are typically exchanged over a standardized interface such as HTTP. Clients, servers, and other connectors can mediate requests without having to know anything beyond the resource's identifier, required action, and the format of the representation that must be returned such as JSON or XML.


## Vocabulary Terms : 

 * functional programming : (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows
 * object-oriented programming (OOP) : is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
 * class : Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
 * The super keyword refers to the parent class.It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
 * this : The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined . In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
 * Test Driven Development (TDD) : is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
 * Jest :  Jest runs previously failed tests first and reorganizes runs based on how long test files take
 * Continuous Integration (CI) :  is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
 * REST : is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP.[1] It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services.
 * Data Model :  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
