# Custom Hooks : 


## What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

 * Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle. There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component's life.

## Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect 

 * We wrap onClick with useCallback to ensure PureHeavyComponent renders only once. Here the pure heavy component is not re-rendered on any render of its parent after the first one.

## Why are functional components preferred over class components?

 * Functional component are much easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-hooks. You end up with less code. They help you to use best practices.

## What is wrong with the following code?

 * in this ex the hooks called inside for loop.
 * Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.

## Vocabulary Terms : 

 1. state hook : A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We'll learn other Hooks later.
 2. effect hook : By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.
 3. reducer hook : useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

## Preview 

* A custom hook allows you to extract some components logic into a reusable function. A custom hook is a Javascript function that starts with use and that call can other hooks. ... We are just refactoring our code into another function to make it reusable
* useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
